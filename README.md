🛒 Blinkit Data Analysis Project

This project uses quick delivery sales data (Blinkit) to find important business insights using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).


🎯 What We Did

Cleaned the Data: We prepared the raw data to make sure all metric calculations were accurate.

Calculated KPIs: We calculated key metrics like Average Order Value, Delivery Time, and Inventory rates.

Built a Dashboard: We created an interactive Power BI dashboard to show the results visually.



💻 Tools Used

SQL: For all data cleanup and metric calculations.
